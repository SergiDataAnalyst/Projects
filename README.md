To mitigate the effects of climate change and protect the environment, Germany set a goal to increase its share of renewable energy in the power generation to 80% by 2050 (Bundesministerium f√ºr Wirtschaft und Energie 2017). However, since renewable energy generation from sources such as wind or sun is highly volatile, accurate forecasts of non-controllable electrical load are necessary to flexibly manage and achieve demand-supply balance. Electricity is currently the most important energy vector in the domestic sector and industry. Unlike fuels, electricity is hard and expensive to store. 
This creates the need of precise coupling between generation and demand. For these reasons, energy consumption fors
